# Required (Note: this is the reading for the whole week)

- <i class="fas fa-book"></i> [Directed Acyclical Graphs in *Causal Inference: The Mixtape*](https://scunning.com/cunningham_mixtape.pdf)^[This reading is mathy-er than what we've covered so far. It also features code from STATA, which we don't use. Don't worry about that so much; we will focus on broad concepts/ideas.]
