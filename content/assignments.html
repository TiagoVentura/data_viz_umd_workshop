<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">You will get the most out of this class</span> if you (1) attend class, (2) complete all the readings, and (3) engage<span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Take detailed notes, do practice exercises, ask for help on the Slack<br />

</span></span> with the readings.</p>
<h2 id="homework">Homework</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">To practice coding in R</span> you will complete 7 problem sets. You need to show that you made a good faith effort to work each question. The problem sets will be graded using a check system:</p>
<ul>
<li>✔+:<span><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"> <em>110% in gradebook</em><br />
<br />
</span></span> Problem set is 100% completed. Every question was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often.</li>
<li>✔:<span><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"> <em>100% in gradebook</em><br />
<br />
</span></span> Problem set is 70–99% complete and most answers are correct. This is the expected level of performance.</li>
<li>✔−:<span><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="marginnote"> <em>50% in gradebook</em><br />
<br />
</span></span> Problem set is less than 70% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not asisgn these often.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may (and should!) work together on the problem sets, but <em>you must turn in your own answers.</em> You cannot work in groups of more than <strong>three</strong> people, and you must note who participated in the group in your assignment.</p>
<h2 id="exams">Exams</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">There will be two exams</span> covering (1) the first half of the course, especially programming, and (2) the second half of the course, especially causation.</p>
<p>More details to come.</p>
<h2 id="code-thru">Code-thru</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">At the end of the course,</span> you will complete a code-through project.</p>
<p>More details to come.</p>
