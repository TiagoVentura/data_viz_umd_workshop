<h2>Online help</h2>
<p>I have been programming in R for years and still find myself Googling how to do basic things that I’ve forgotten about. Other times, I encounter new coding problems where I can’t quite come up with a good solution.</p>
<!-- ![](/media/googling-error.png) -->
<p><img src="/media/googling-error.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/></p>
<p>Fortunately there are tons of online resources to help you. The most important is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> (a Q&amp;A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions). I will point to others as the semester advances.</p>

<!-- ## Guides -->
<!-- - [R Style Guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html). Write readable code.  -->
<!-- - [Jenny Bryan's Stat 545](http://stat545-ubc.github.io/topics.html). Notes and tutorials for a Data Analysis course taught by [Jennifer Bryan](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/) at the University of British Columbia. Lots of useful material. -->
<!-- - [knitr demos](http://yihui.name/knitr/demos) Documentation and examples for `knitr` by its author, Yihui Xie. There is also a [knitr book](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1498716962/) covering the same ground in more detail. -->
<!-- - [Rmarkdown documentation](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) from the makers of RStudio. Lots of good examples. -->
<!-- - [Plain Person's Guide](http://github.com/kjhealy/plain-text.co) The git repository for this project. -->
<!-- - [Karl Broman's Tutorials and Guides](http://kbroman.org/pages/tutorials) Accurate and concise guides to many of the tools and topics described here, including [getting started with reproducible research](http://kbroman.org/steps2rr), [using git and GitHub](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial), and [working with knitr](http://kbroman.org/knitr_knutshell). -->
<!-- - [Makefiles for OCR and converting Shapefiles](http://lincolnmullen.com/blog/makefiles-for-ocr-and-converting-shapefiles). Some further examples of `Makefiles` in the data-analysis pipeline, by [Lincoln Mullen](http://lincolnmullen.com) -->
<!-- ## Tools -->
<!-- - [Apple's Developer Tools](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2339/_index.html) Unix toolchain. Install directly with `xcode-select --install`, or just try to use e.g. `git` from the terminal and have OS X prompt you to install the tools. -->
<!-- - [Homebrew package manager](http://brew.sh). A convenient way to install several of the tools here, including Emacs and Pandoc. -->
<!-- - [R](http://r-project.org). A platform for statistical computing. -->
<!-- - [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/). Reproducible plain-text documents from within R.  -->
<!-- - [Python](http://python.org) and [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/). Python is a general-purpose programming language increasingly used in data manipulation and analysis. -->
<!-- - [RStudio](http://rstudio.com). An IDE for R. The most straightforward way to get into using R and RMarkdown. -->
<!-- - [TeX and LaTeX](http://tug.org). A typesetting and document preparation system. You can write files in `.tex` format directly, but it is more useful to just have it available in the background for other tools to use. The [MacTeX Distribution](http://tug.org/mactex) is the one to install for macOS. -->
<!-- - [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org). Converts plain-text documents to and from a wide variety of formats. Can be installed with Homebrew. Be sure to also install `pandoc-citeproc` for processing citations and bibliographies, and `pandoc-crossref` for producing cross-references and labels. -->
<!-- - [Git](http://git-scm.org). Version control system. Installs with Apple's Developer Tools, or get the latest version via Homebrew. -->
<!-- - [GNU Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make). You tell `make` what the steps are to create the pieces of a document or program. As you edit and change the various pieces, it automatically figures out which pieces need to be updated and recompiled, and issues the commands to do that. See Karl Broman's [Minimal Make](http://kbroman.org/minimal_make/) for a short introduction. Make will be installed automatically with Apple's developer tools. -->
<!-- - [lintr](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) and [flycheck](https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck). Tools that nudge you to write neater code.     -->
