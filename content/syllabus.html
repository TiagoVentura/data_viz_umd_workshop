<br />
</span></span> also being used to make <strong>causal</strong> claims about the world – to argue that taking some course of action will improve or worsen our lives.</p>
<p>In this class, you will learn how to <strong>do</strong> data analysis and how to <strong>think</strong> causally.</p>
<p>You will spend a lot of time getting off the ground in <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, a powerful and in-demand programming language that will allow you to manipulate, summarize, and visualize the data that you care about.</p>
<p>You will also develop a language and set of tools for determining whether, and how, we can know that one thing <em>causes</em> another using data.</p>
<p>This course is meant for students without any statistics or programming background. We will emphasize hands-on application with software and intuition-building over statistical theory and mathematical proofs.<span><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">The foundation you develop here can be built upon in future methods courses.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="newthought">By the end of this course,</span> you will be able to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Feel comfortable manipulating data in R</li>
<li>Craft effective visualizations of patterns in data</li>
<li>Draw causal diagrams and identify challenges to causal claims</li>
<li>Understand the basics of causal inference</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="articles-and-other-readings">Articles and other readings</h3>
<p>Outside of the textbooks, I will post links to additional articles and videos on this site.</p>
<p>I also recommend subscribing to the <a href="https://rweekly.org/">R Weekly newsletter</a>. This weekly email is full of helpful tutorials about how to do stuff with R.</p>
<h3 id="r-and-rstudio">R and RStudio</h3>
<p>You will do all of your analysis with the open source (and free!) programming language <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">R</a>. You will use <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.</p>
<h3 id="email-and-slack">Email and Slack</h3>
<p><span class="newthought">Slack will be our main mode of communication.</span> We have a class Slack channel where anyone in the class can ask questions and anyone can answer. Ask questions about coding (e.g., “how do I summarize multiple variables at once?”) or class logistics (e.g., “I can’t find the reading”) in the class Slack workspace.</p>
<p>I will monitor Slack regularly, and you should all do so as well. You’ll have similar questions as your peers, and you’ll likely be able to answer other peoples’ questions too. I will also post announcements and interesting/helpful content on Slack as the semester progresses.</p>
<p>If you would like to speak with me about something that only pertains to <em>you</em> (e.g., your grades, academic advice, reading suggestions), you can sign up for office hours on <a href="https://calendly.com/juan-f-tellez">Calendly</a>. If there’s a time-sensitive emergency (e.g., car exploded) you can email me. Everything else goes in the Slack.</p>
<h3 id="online-help">Online help</h3>
<p>I have been programming in R for years and still find myself Googling how to do basic things that I’ve forgotten about. Other times, I encounter new coding problems where I can’t quite come up with a good solution.</p>
<p><a href="/images/googling-error.png"><img src="/images/googling-error.png" /></a></p>
<p>Fortunately there are tons of online resources to help you. The most important is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> (a Q&amp;A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions). I will point to others as the semester advances.</p>
<h3 id="honor-code">Honor Code</h3>
<p><span class="newthought">Be nice. Don’t cheat.</span> The Carolinian Creed is in effect in this class and all others at the University. I will treat violations seriously and urge all students to become familiar with its terms set out <a href="https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_conduct_and_academic_integrity/index.php">here</a>. If you have doubts, it is your responsibility to ask about the Creed’s application.</p>
<h3 id="cell-phones-and-laptops">Cell Phones and Laptops</h3>
<ul>
<li>Please turn off your phones or put them on silent before class.</li>
<li>Be respectful with your laptop use. This course will involve heavy laptop use in class, so it is up to you to avoid distractions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="counseling-psychiatry-services">Counseling &amp; Psychiatry Services</h3>
<p>Life at USC can be complicated and challenging. You might feel overwhelmed, experience anxiety or depression, or struggle with relationships or family responsibilities. <a href="https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_health_services/medical-services/counseling-and-psychiatry/index.php">Counseling and Psychiatry Services</a> provides <em>confidential</em> support for students who are struggling with mental health and emotional challenges. Please do not hesitate to contact CAPS for assistance—getting help is a smart and good thing to do.</p>
