# Things you should know for Midterm
## You should know how to...


- ...plot the five most common graphs in `ggplot()`
- ...when to use `facet_wrap` and how to use it
- ...customize `color`
- ...use `theme_()` effectively
- ...extract subsets of a dataset using `filter`
- ...use the logical operators effectively (`==`, `!=`, `&`, `|`)
- ...calculate summary statistics (mean, median, min, max) using `summarise`
- ...calculate these statistics *by* one or more variables using `group_by()`
- ...calculate group *proportions* using `group_by` (e.g., the *gss_cat* example from homework 3)
- ...create new variables out of existing ones using `mutate`
- ...code new variables using `case_when`
- ...sort dataframes by one or more variables using `arrange`f
- ...keep only a subset of variables in your dataset using `select`
- ...merge two datasets with `inner_join`, *even when* the datasets have differently named keys in common
- ...convert categorical variables to factors using `factor` and `factor_reorder`
- ...tidy data at a conceptual level, i.e., know what it means for data to be "tidy"
- ...transform data from wide format to long format using `gather`
- ...draw a trend line using `geom_smooth`
- ...talk about and interpret correlation coefficients
- ...speak the language of statistical modeling, i.e., outcome variable, explanatory variable
- ...run an OLS model using `lm` and extract its output
- ... interpret results from an OLS model, e.g., the coefficient, "one unit change in..."
- ...interpret coefficient estimates of *continuous* and *categorical* variables


# Things you should know for Final

I will populate this throughout semester.
