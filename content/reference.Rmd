# Things you should know for Midterm
## You should know how to...


- ...plot the five most common graphs in `ggplot()`
- ...when to use `facet_wrap` and how to use it
- ...customize `color`
- ...use `theme_()` effectively
- ...extract subsets of a dataset using `filter`
- ...use the logical operators effectively (`==`, `!=`, `&`, `|`)
- ...calculate summary statistics (mean, median, min, max) using `summarise`
- ...calculate these statistics *by* one or more variables using `group_by()`
- ...calculate group *proportions* using `group_by` (e.g., the *gss_cat* example from homework 3)
- ...create new variables out of existing ones using `mutate`
- ...code new variables using `case_when`
- ...sort dataframes by one or more variables using `arrange`f
- ...keep only a subset of variables in your dataset using `select`
- ...merge two datasets with `inner_join`, *even when* the datasets have differently named keys in common
- ...convert categorical variables to factors using `factor` and `factor_reorder`
- ...tidy data, transforming data from wide format to long format using `gather`
- ...draw a trend line using `geom_smooth`, and be able to extract and interpret regression output from an OLS model `lm`
