# Preparation

<span class="newthought">You will get the most out of this class</span> if you (1) attend class, (2) complete all the readings, and (3) engage^[Take detailed notes, do practice exercises, ask for help on the Slack]  with the readings.


# Homework

<span class="newthought">To practice coding in R</span> you will complete problem sets throughout the semester. You need to show that you made a good faith effort to work each question. Grades will be a function of effort + correct answers. 


Feel free to work together on the problem sets but *you must turn in your own answers.* You cannot work in groups of more than **three** people.


I'll accept problem sets late one day (but you will lose a full letter-grade). Beyond that I won't accept late problem sets. 


# Exams

<span class="newthought">There will be two exams</span> covering (1) the first half of the course, especially programming, and (2) the second half of the course, especially causation.
