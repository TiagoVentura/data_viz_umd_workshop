# Instructions


1. Download this: [`PS-VIZ`](/files/ps-viz.zip), *unzip* it, then double-click on the `.Rproj` file to open RStudio

2. Ensure that you have the needed packages installed on your computer. If you try to run `library(PACKAGE NAME)` and R returns an error that the package is missing, use the “Packages” panel in RStudio to install it

3. Replace the `your-name` part of the R Markdown file `your-name_problem-set-1.Rmd` to something that matches your name and open it in RStudio

4. Complete the tasks in the R Markdown file. Fill out code in the empty chunks provided and replace FILL YOUR ANSWER HERE with your answers to the questions.

5. When you’re all done, click on the “Knit” button at the top of the editing window and create a WORD document of your problem set. Email me the WORD doc **and only the WORD doc**.


```{r knit-button, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
