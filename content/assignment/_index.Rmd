## Preparation

You will get the most out of this class if you (1) attend class, (2) do the homework, and (3) engage with the readings.


## Homework

*To practice coding in R* you will complete problem sets throughout the semester. You need to show that you made a good faith effort to work each question. Grades will be a function of effort + correct answers. 


Feel free to work together on the problem sets but **you must turn in your own answers.** You cannot work in groups of more than **three** people.


I'll accept problem sets late one day (but you will lose a full letter-grade). Beyond that I won't accept late problem sets. 


## Exams

*There will be two exams* covering (1) the first half of the course, especially programming, and (2) the second half of the course, especially causation.

Make-up exams will be given **only** to students with medical or personal emergencies. If an emergency arises, you will need to contact me **before** the exam or you will receive zero credit.
