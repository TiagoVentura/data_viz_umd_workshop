<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>You will get the most out of this class if you (1) attend class, (2) do the homework, and (3) engage with the readings.</p>
</div>
<div id="homework" class="section level2">
<h2>Homework</h2>
<p><em>To practice coding in R</em> you will complete problem sets throughout the semester. You need to show that you made a good faith effort to work each question. Grades will be a function of effort + correct answers.</p>
<p>Feel free to work together on the problem sets but <strong>you must turn in your own answers.</strong> You cannot work in groups of more than <strong>three</strong> people.</p>
<p>I’ll accept problem sets late one day (but you will lose a full letter-grade). Beyond that I won’t accept late problem sets.</p>
</div>
<div id="exams" class="section level2">
<h2>Exams</h2>
<p><em>There will be two exams</em> covering (1) the first half of the course, especially programming, and (2) the second half of the course, especially causation.</p>
<p>Make-up exams will be given <strong>only</strong> to students with medical or personal emergencies. If an emergency arises, you will need to contact me <strong>before</strong> the exam or you will receive zero credit.</p>
