# Instructions

1. Download this file, *unzip it*, and double click on the file named `problem-set-1.Rproj`: [<i class="fas fa-file-archive"></i> `problem-set-1.zip`](/files/problem-set-1.zip)
    - Alternatively, if you're using RStudio.cloud, make a copy of the project named "Problem set 1"

2. Ensure you have these packages installed on your computer: `tidyverse` and `babynames`. If you try to load one of those packages with `library(tidyverse)` or `library(babynames)` and R gives an error that the package is missing, use the "Packages" panel in RStudio to install it.

3. Rename the R Markdown file named `your-name_problem-set-1.Rmd` to something that matches your name and open it in RStudio.

4. Complete the two tasks given in the R Markdown file. Fill out code in the empty chunks provided (you can definitely copy, paste, and adapt from ModernDive and DataCamp!), and replace text in ALL CAPS with your own (i.e. you'll see a lot of `TYPE YOUR ANSWER HERE`s. Type your answers there.)

5. When you're all done, click on the "Knit" button at the top of the editing window and create a Word document of your problem set. Upload that file to Learning Suite.

```{r knit-button, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/images/assignment/knit-button.png")
```
