# Code


Here's the EITC example we discussed in class. [EITC data here](/files/eitc-nick-ch.csv).^[Example and data from Nick-CH.]


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

df = read.csv("static/files/eitc-nick-ch.csv")

# create treatment and timing variable
df = 
  df  %>%
  mutate(after = ifelse(year >= 1994, "after", "before"),
         treated = ifelse(children > 0, "kids", "no kids"))


# plot trends
pdata = 
  df %>% 
  group_by(year, treated) %>% 
  summarise(work = mean(work))

pdata
ggplot(pdata, aes(x = year, y = work, color = treated)) + 
  geom_line(size = 2) + 
  # make line at point where it crosses
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1994, lty = 2) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Percent of single women working")


# Diff in diff, simple calculation
did = 
  df %>% group_by(treated, after) %>% 
  summarize(work = mean(work))

did
untreat.diff = did$work[3]-did$work[4]
treat.diff = did$work[1]-did$work[2]
did.estimate = treat.diff - untreat.diff
did.estimate
```
