What is incumbency worth?^[example taken from Nick-CH] If you win one election, how likely are you to win a subsequent one? Let's take a regression discontinuity approach to this question. 

Data cleaning steps: 

1. Install and load the `politicaldata` package, and load `data(house_results)`
2. Use `filter` to separate into two new dataframes, one for 2012 and one for 2016
3. For 2012, create new variable (`r_margin`) that tells us the difference in vote share between R and D
4. For 2016, create new variable (`r_wins`) that tells us if R beat D (i.e., vote share of R > vote share of D)
5. In each data set, `select` only `district` and the new variable
6. Use `drop_na` to get rid of missing observations
7. `inner_join` the two resulting datasets


The discontinuity: 

- Think about how to compare the percentage of times `r_wins` just above and below a small threshold in `r_margin` (say, .04)
