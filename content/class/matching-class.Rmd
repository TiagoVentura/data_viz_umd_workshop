# Code for class


Update: looks like using `cem` in `matchit()` requires installing a few more things on your computer, which is not worth the hassle at this point. So, don't include `method = "cem"` in your function call. This means we're not doing CEM; we're instead doing something called "nearest neighbor" matching. Different, but the basic idea is still the same. 

Note that now there is no need to do `"weights = weights"` in the `lm()` call. 


```{r, eval=FALSE}
# m atching with swiss data: does education increase/reduce fertility?
library(tidyverse)
library(MatchIt) # you're also gonna need to install "cem"
data("swiss")


# step 1: id matching variables and clean up data
match_swiss = 
  swiss %>% 
  # this is a tricky part of matchit package; treatment variable (education), needs to be 0/1
  # here we define education treatment as "above average education vs. below average"
  mutate(edu_treat = ifelse(Education > mean(Education), 1, 0))


# step 2: match using cem
# same formula as lm(), except the outcome here is treatment variable (edu_treat)
match_model = matchit(edu_treat ~ Agriculture + Catholic + Examination, 
                      data = match_swiss)


# step 3: evaluate balance
summary(match_model)
## Note: notice that balance for some variables got better, some got worse, 
## and those that got better didn't get that much better

# step 4: estimate effect
matched_data = match.data(match_model) ## extracts the new, matched dataset
lm(Fertility ~ edu_treat, data = matched_data)



# # practice: Does being in a union pay off?
# library(Ecdat)
# data("Wages")
# Wages %>% 
#   select(lwage, union, black, bluecol, south, exp, sex) %>% 
#   sample_n(5)
```
