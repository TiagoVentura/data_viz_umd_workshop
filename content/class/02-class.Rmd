# In-class examples

Here's the code and data we'll be working with in class. These are also accessible in RStudio.cloud.

- Movies and the 5 named graphs: [<i class="fas fa-file-archive"></i> `movies-5ng.zip`](/files/movies-5ng.zip)
- Bird collisions at the SLC airport: [<i class="fas fa-file-archive"></i> `airport-birds.zip`](/files/airport-birds.zip)


# Guessing the identity of the Trump resistance op-ed writer with R

- [David Robinson's approach](http://varianceexplained.org/r/op-ed-text-analysis/)
- Mike Kearney's approach: [his code](https://github.com/mkearney/resist_oped) and [his short article](https://www.rjionline.org/stories/we-put-data-science-to-the-test-to-try-to-uncover-the-mystery-author-of-the)

# Clearest and muddiest things

Go to [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/PlPwZGhMOdU9mKfC3) and answer these three questions:

1. What was the muddiest thing from class today? What are you still wondering about?
2. What was the clearest thing from class today? 
3. What was the most exciting thing you learned?

I'll compile the questions and send out answers after class.
