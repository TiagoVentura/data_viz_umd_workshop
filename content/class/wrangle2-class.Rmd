# In-class examples

Here's the code we'll be using in class. 

- Practicing data-wrangling with [NYC flight data](https://github.com/hadley/nycflights13): [<i class="fas fa-file-archive"></i> `nycflights-wrangle`](/files/nycflights-wrangle.R)


Here's the code I referenced: 

```{r example-code, eval=FALSE}
# look at flights from destinations that are hotter than average
# calculate the median arrival delay for each carrier in each day
weather_flights = inner_join(flights, weather, by = c("year", "month", 
                                    "day", "hour", 
                                    "origin"))

weather_flights %>% 
  filter(temp > mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(carrier, day) %>% 
  summarise(med_delay = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```
