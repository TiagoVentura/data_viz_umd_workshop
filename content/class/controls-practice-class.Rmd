#  fake data

  # let's say esteem scale runs from 0 to 4, and boys have on average 3 higher esteem
  mutate(esteem = 3*boy + runif(500, min = 0, max = 4)) %>% 
  # let's say boys bullshit more. But people with higher self-esteem bullshit less. 
  mutate(bullshit = 2*boy - .3*esteem + rnorm(500, mean = 2))
