# M&Ms

In class we used M&Ms to explore how sampling works. Here's an analysis of this exploration in R. Load these packages to get started, and download these two datasets (and put them in a folder named "data"):

- [<i class="fas fa-table"></i> `tons_of_mms.csv`](/data/tons_of_mms.csv)
- [<i class="fas fa-table"></i> `class_mms.csv`](/data/class_mms.csv)

## The true population parameters of M&M colors

Because of [the work of smart/bored statisticians](https://blogs.sas.com/content/iml/2017/02/20/proportion-of-colors-mandms.html) (and from the Mars company itself), we actually know the true population-level parameters for the proportion of colors. For whatever reason, M&Ms's two US factories produce a different mix of colors (perhaps the East Coast likes blue M&Ms more?). Here are the true population parameters:

```{r show-population, results="asis"}
mms_population <- tribble(
  ~color,   ~prop_clv, ~prop_hkp,
  "Red",    0.131,     0.125,
  "Orange", 0.205,     0.25,
  "Yellow", 0.135,     0.125,
  "Green",  0.198,     0.125,
  "Blue",   0.207,     0.25,
  "Brown",  0.124,     0.125
)

mms_population %>% 
  gather(Factory, value, -color) %>% 
  mutate(value = percent(value)) %>% 
  spread(color, value) %>% 
  mutate(Factory = recode(Factory,
                          prop_clv = "Cleveland, OH (CLV)",
                          prop_hkp = "Hackettstown, NJ (HKP)")) %>% 
  pandoc.table(justify = "lcccccc")
```


## M&Ms in real life

Here are the results of the M&M sampling that we did in class:

### Individual fun-packs

```{r real-individual-props}
individual_data <- class_results %>% 
  filter(type == "Myself") %>%
  gather(color, count, c(Blue, Brown, Green, Orange, Red, Yellow)) %>% 
  mutate(prop = count / total) 

individual_data %>% 
  group_by(color) %>% 
  summarise(avg_prop = mean(prop),
            sd_prop = sd(prop))
```

```{r plot-real-individual}
ggplot(individual_data, aes(x = prop, fill = color)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, color = "white") +
  geom_vline(data = mms_population, aes(xintercept = prop_clv),
             color = "orange", size = 1, linetype = "dotted") +
  labs(x = "Proportion", y = "Count", title = "Actual colors in 31 fun-sized bags",
       subtitle = "Orange dotted line shows the true population value") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(mm_blue, mm_brown, mm_green, mm_orange, mm_red, mm_yellow)) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
  facet_wrap(~ color)
```

### Team checkout-line-sized bags

```{r real-team-props}
team_data <- class_results %>% 
  filter(type == "My team") %>%
  gather(color, count, c(Blue, Brown, Green, Orange, Red, Yellow)) %>% 
  mutate(prop = count / total) 

team_data %>% 
  group_by(color) %>% 
  summarise(avg_prop = mean(prop),
            sd_prop = sd(prop))
```

```{r plot-real-team}
ggplot(team_data, aes(x = prop, fill = color)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, color = "white") +
  geom_vline(data = mms_population, aes(xintercept = prop_clv),
             color = "orange", size = 1, linetype = "dotted") +
  labs(x = "Proportion", y = "Count", title = "Actual colors in 11 checkout-line-sized bags",
       subtitle = "Orange dotted line shows the true population value") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(mm_blue, mm_brown, mm_green, mm_orange, mm_red, mm_yellow)) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
  facet_wrap(~ color)
```


## Simulated M&Ms

We can use the `rep_sample_n()` function from the `moderndive` library to simulate taking a random sample from a giant vat of 100,000 Cleveland-produced M&Ms.

Here's what happens if we take one fun-sized sample of M&Ms:

```{r simluated-one-bag-draw}
one_fun_sized_bag <- tons_of_mms %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 19)

one_fun_sized_bag
```

We can calculate the proportion of colors in this one bag:

```{r simulated-one-bag}
one_fun_sized_bag %>% 
  group_by(color) %>% 
  summarize(prop = n() / 19)
```

Just looking at one bag will result in a lot of variability. Some colors might not be in the bag; some colors might be overrepresented in the bag. We can improve our estimates of $\widehat{p}$ by increasing the number of samples we take. Here's what happens if we look at 40 fun-sized bags, just like we did in-person in class:

```{r simulated-forty-bags}
forty_fun_sized_bags <- tons_of_mms %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 19, reps = 40)

forty_fun_sized_bags_color <- forty_fun_sized_bags %>% 
  group_by(color, replicate) %>%
  summarize(prop = n() / 19) 

forty_fun_sized_bags_color %>% 
  summarise(avg_prop = mean(prop),
            sd_prop = sd(prop))
```

```{r plot-simulated-forty-bags}
ggplot(forty_fun_sized_bags_color, aes(x = prop, fill = color)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, color = "white") +
  geom_vline(data = mms_population, aes(xintercept = prop_clv),
             color = "orange", size = 1, linetype = "dotted") +
  labs(x = "Proportion", y = "Count", title = "Simulation of 40 party-sized bags",
       subtitle = "Orange dotted line shows the true population value") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(mm_blue, mm_brown, mm_green, mm_orange, mm_red, mm_yellow)) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
  facet_wrap(~ color)
```

There's still some variability, but the standard deviation is smaller than it was with just one fun-sized bag.

Next let's simulate 10 checkout-line-sized bags (what we did as teams in class). These have roughly 55 M&Ms per bag:

```{r simulated-checkout-bags}
ten_checkout_sized_bags <- tons_of_mms %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 55, reps = 10)

ten_checkout_sized_bags_color <- ten_checkout_sized_bags %>% 
  group_by(color, replicate) %>%
  summarize(prop = n() / 55) 

ten_checkout_sized_bags_color %>% 
  summarise(avg_prop = mean(prop),
            sd_prop = sd(prop))
```

Our errors are shrinking and the means are starting to converge on the true population $p$:

```{r plot-ten-checkout}
ggplot(ten_checkout_sized_bags_color, aes(x = prop, fill = color)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.025, color = "white") +
  geom_vline(data = mms_population, aes(xintercept = prop_clv),
             color = "orange", size = 1, linetype = "dotted") +
  labs(x = "Proportion", y = "Count", title = "Simulation of 10 checkout-line-sized bags",
       subtitle = "Orange dotted line shows the true population value") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(mm_blue, mm_brown, mm_green, mm_orange, mm_red, mm_yellow)) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
  facet_wrap(~ color)
```

Now let's move beyond what we did in class. Let's simulate 10 party-sized bags (42 ounces; each contains roughly 1,000 M&Ms):

```{r ten-party}
ten_party_sized_bags <- tons_of_mms %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 1000, reps = 10)

ten_party_sized_bags_color <- ten_party_sized_bags %>% 
  group_by(color, replicate) %>%
  summarize(prop = n() / 1000) 

ten_party_sized_bags_color %>% 
  summarise(avg_prop = mean(prop),
            sd_prop = sd(prop))
```

The errors are now substantially smaller. Check out how little variation there is!

```{r plot-ten-party}
ggplot(ten_party_sized_bags_color, aes(x = prop, fill = color)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.025, color = "white") +
  geom_vline(data = mms_population, aes(xintercept = prop_clv),
             color = "orange", size = 1, linetype = "dotted") +
  labs(x = "Proportion", y = "Count", title = "Simulation of 10 party-sized bags",
       subtitle = "Orange dotted line shows the true population value") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(mm_blue, mm_brown, mm_green, mm_orange, mm_red, mm_yellow)) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
  facet_wrap(~ color)
```

With only 10 large-ish bags of M&Ms (420 ounces, or 26.25 pounds), we can guess the proportion of colors for *the entire population of M&Ms created in Cleveland* with fairly high confidence. That's amazing.


## The importance of sample size

As a final demonstration of this, here's a simulation of what happens to our $\widehat{p}$ estimates and margins of error as we increase the sample size from 5 to 1,000. The x-axis here show the sample size; the y-axis shows the $\widehat{p}$ for each color at that sample size; the orange ribbon shows the 95% confidence interval, or margin of error; the black horizontal line shows the true population average.

```{r different-ns, cache=TRUE}
different_ns <- data_frame(n = seq(5, 1000, 1)) %>% 
  mutate(draw = n %>% map(~ rep_sample_n(tons_of_mms, size = .x, reps = 1))) %>% 
  unnest(draw) %>% 
  group_by(n, color) %>% 
  summarize(prop = n() / max(n)) %>% 
  # This is the real way of calculating the margin of error; we'll talk about this next week
  mutate(se = sqrt(prop * (1 - prop) / n),
         moe = 1.96 * se,
         lower_ci = prop - moe,
         upper_ci = prop + moe)

ggplot(different_ns, aes(x = n, y = prop)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower_ci, ymax = upper_ci), fill = "orange") +
  geom_line(size = 0.25) +
  geom_hline(data = mms_population, aes(yintercept = prop_clv), size = 2, color = "white") +
  geom_hline(data = mms_population, aes(yintercept = prop_clv), size = 0.75, color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Sample size (n)", y = "Proportion", title = "Accuracy of p-hat as sample size increases",
       subtitle = "Black horizontal line shows the true population value ") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = comma) +
  facet_wrap(~ color) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

Notice how the estimates and errors converge on the true $p$ fairly quickly. When $n$ is small, there's a lot of variation, but once it's 250+, there's not a huge improvement as you increase the sample size. 

This is even more apparent if we plot just the changes in the margin of error as we increase $n$:

```{r plot-moe-different-ns}
ggplot(different_ns, aes(x = n, y = moe)) + 
  geom_point(size = 0.25, alpha = 0.25) +
  labs(x = "Sample size (n)", y = "Margin of error (± this percent)") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = comma) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

Notice how low the margin of error is at 1,000. Given that there are roughly 1,000 M&Ms in a 42 ounce party bag, we can make a pretty good guess (with a margin of error of 2ish%) of the actual population-level distribution of colors with *just one big bag of M&Ms*. That's mindblowing.

This is why presidential approval polls tend to have $n$s that seem really low (1,300; 1,500; 800, etc.). Polls with these sample sizes all have margins of error of 2–3%. Bumping up the sample size to 10,000 or something huge would shrink the margins of error, but not by a huge amount. If we took a sample of 10,000 M&Ms, here's what our margin of error would be:

```{r moe-10000}
tons_of_mms %>% 
  rep_sample_n(10000) %>% 
  group_by(color) %>% 
  summarize(prop = n() / 10000) %>% 
  mutate(se = sqrt(prop * (1 - prop) / 10000),
         moe = 1.96 * se,
         lower_ci = prop - moe,
         upper_ci = prop + moe)
```

Between 0.65% and 0.8%, depending on the color. That's definitely an improvement over 2%, but it's not huge. Consider, for instance, moving from a sample size of 20, where the margin of error is 20ish%, to a sample size of 500, where it's around 4%. Increasing sample sizes at the low end of the spectrum results in huge gains to $\widehat{p}$ accuracy. Increasing sample sizes from high to even higher doesn't end up helping all that much with accuracy. 

Pew, CNN, Quinnipiac, and others face a tradeoff: take huge (expensive) samples to get the most accurate estimate of $\widehat{p}$, or take smaller (cheaper) samples to get $\widehat{p}$ estimates that are less accurate, but still pretty darn accurate in the end. They lean towards the cheaper option.
