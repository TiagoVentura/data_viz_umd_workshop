# Course objectives

<span class="newthought">Data is everywhere.</span>[^courseinfo] Policymakers, academics, journalists and sports analysts are using data every day to make decisions. Data is^[Yes, I know "data" is plural. I don't care.] also being used to make **causal** claims about the world -- to argue that taking some course of action will improve or worsen our lives. 

In this class, you will learn how to **do** data analysis and how to **think** about causation. 

You will spend a lot of time getting off the ground in [R](https://www.r-project.org/), a powerful and in-demand programming language that will allow you to manipulate, summarize, and visualize the data that you care about. 

You will also spend a lot of time building a language and set of tools for determining whether and how we can know that one thing *causes* another using data. 


This course is meant for students without any statistics or programming background. We will emphasize hands-on application with software and intuition-building over statistical theory and mathematical proofs. The foundation you develop here can be built upon in future methods courses.

  `r blogdown::shortcode("courseinfo")`


<span class="newthought">By the end of this course,</span> you will be able to:


1. Feel comfortable using R to manipulate data
2. Display patterns in data with visualizations
3. Draw causal diagrams and identify challenges to causal claims
4. Understand the basics of regression


# Course materials

<span class="newthought">All materials for this course are free and online.</span> 

## Books

- [^md] [**ModernDive**](https://moderndive.com/): ModernDive will be our primary textbook. 

- [^r4ds] [**R for Data Science**](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/): Some of your readings will also come from the free R for Data Science book.

## Articles and other readings


From time to time you will also read articles or watch videos outside of the assigned books. I will include links to these other sources in the reading page for that week. 

I also recommend subscribing to the [R Weekly newsletter](https://rweekly.org/). This weekly email is full of helpful tutorials about how to do stuff with R.




## R and RStudio

You will do all of your analysis with the open source (and free!) programming language [R](https://cran.r-project.org/). You will use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.


You can [find instructions for installing R, RStudio, and all the tidyverse packages here.](/install/)



## Email and Slack


<span class="newthought">Slack will be our main mode of communication.</span> We have a class Slack channel where anyone in the class can ask questions and anyone can answer. Ask questions about coding (e.g., "how do I summarize multiple variables at once?") or class logistics (e.g., "I can't find the reading") in the class Slack workspace. 

I will monitor Slack regularly, and you should all do so as well. You'll have similar questions as your peers, and you'll likely be able to answer other peoples' questions too. I will also post announcements and interesting/helpful content on Slack as the semester progresses.

If you would like to speak with me about something that only pertains to *you* (e.g., your grades, academic advice, reading suggestions), you can sign up for office hours on [Calendly](https://calendly.com/juan-f-tellez). If there's a time-sensitive emergency (e.g., car exploded) you can email me. Everything else goes in the Slack. 


## Online help


[![](/images/googling-error.png)](/images/googling-error.png)



I have been programming in R for years and still find myself Googling how to do basic things that I've forgotten about. Other times, I encounter new coding problems where I can't quite come up with a good solution. 


Fortunately there are tons of online resources to help you. The most important is [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) (a Q&A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions). I will point to others as the semester advances.



## Honor Code

<span class="newthought">Be nice. Don't cheat.</span> The Carolinian Creed is in effect in this class and all others at the University. I will treat violations seriously and urge all students to become familiar with its terms set out [here](https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_conduct_and_academic_integrity/index.php). If you have doubts, it is your responsibility to ask about the Creed’s application.


## Cell Phones and Laptops


- Please turn off your phones or put them on silent before class. 
- Be respectful with your laptop use. You're adults.


## Counseling & Psychiatry Services


Life at USC can be complicated and challenging. You might feel overwhelmed, experience anxiety or depression, or struggle with relationships or family responsibilities. [Counseling and Psychiatry Services](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_health_services/medical-services/counseling-and-psychiatry/index.php) provides *confidential* support for students who are struggling with mental health and emotional challenges. Please do not hesitate to contact CAPS for assistance—getting help is a smart and good thing to do.



# Assignments and grades

<span class="newthought">You can find descriptions</span> for all the assignments on the [assignments page](/assignments/).


```{r assignments-grades, include=FALSE}
assignments <- tribble(
  ~Points, ~Assignment,
  250  , "Problem sets (7 × 40)",
  50      , "Code-through",
  100     , "Midterm",
  100     , "Final"
) %>%
  mutate(Percent = Points / sum(Points),
         Percent = scales::percent(Percent))

grading <- tribble(
  ~Grade, ~Range, ~Grade1, ~Range1,
  "A",  "93–100%", "C",  "73–76%",
  "A−", "90–92%", "C−", "70–72%",
  "B+", "87–89%", "D+", "67–69%",
  "B",  "83–86%", "D",  "63–66%",
  "B−", "80–82%", "D−", "60–62%",
  "C+", "77–79%", "F",  "< 60%"
)
```

```{r show-assignments-table, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
assignments_total <- tibble(Assignment = "Total",
                                Points = sum(assignments$Points),
                                Percent = NA)

bind_rows(assignments, assignments_total) %>% 
  select(Assignment, Points, Percent) %>% 
  pandoc.table(justify = "lcc", missing = "—")
```

\

```{r show-grades-table, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
grading %>%
  pandoc.table(justify = "lclc", 
               col.names = c("Grade", "Range", "Grade", "Range"))
```

# Red pandas

[^panda] <span class="newthought">Once you have read</span> this entire syllabus and [the assignments page](/assignments/), please a picture of a red panda to the Slack.
